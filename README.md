# Random Color Live Wallpaper

Solid color wallpaper that changes color (animates), for Android.

Uses current time in format hh:mm:ss as hex color code to change a solid color wallpaper every second. Has several display options and an invert color option.

This is pre-alpha because additional functionality is planned. Here is the [https://github.com/earthbound19/random-color-live-wallpaper-android/projects/1](project board).

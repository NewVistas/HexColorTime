# Random Color Live Wallpaper

Solid color wallpaper that changes color (animates), for Android.

Uses current time in format hh:mm:ss as hex color code (e.g. 11:07 PM (23:07 military time) and 07 seconds as hex #230751, a dark purple) to change a solid color wallpaper every second. Has several display options and an invert color option.

This is pre-alpha because additional functionality is planned. Here is the [project board](https://github.com/earthbound19/random-color-live-wallpaper-android/projects/1).

## Features
- Three text appearances: time (09:44:07), hex color (#094407) or no text
- Change typography (Default, Default Bold, Monospace, Sans Serif or Serif)
- Change text size
- Invert colors
